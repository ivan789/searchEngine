                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
   3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
   4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
   6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
   7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
   8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
   9. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   5.

      For the avoidance of doubt:
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

Alternative column ordering
===========================

When using queryset data, one might want to show a computed value which is not
in the database. In this case, attempting to order the column will cause an
exception::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        family_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

        @property
        def name(self):
            return '{} {}'.format(self.first_name, self.family_name)

    # tables.py
    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

::

    >>> table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())
    >>> table.order_by = 'name'
    >>>
    >>> # will result in:
    FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'name' into field. Choices are: first_name, family_name

To prevent this, django-tables2 allows two ways to specify custom ordering:
accessors and :meth:`~.order_FOO` methods.

.. _order-by-accessors:

Ordering by accessors
---------------------

You can supply an ``order_by`` argument containing a name or a tuple of the
names of the columns the database should use to sort it::

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column(order_by=('first_name', 'family_name'))

`~.Accessor` syntax can be used as well, as long as they point to a model field.

If ordering does not make sense for a particular column, it can be disabled via
the ``orderable`` argument::

    class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()
        actions = tables.Column(orderable=False)


.. _table.order_foo:

:meth:`table.order_FOO` methods
--------------------------------

Another solution for alternative ordering is being able to chain functions on to
the original queryset. This method allows more complex functionality giving the
ability to use all of Django's QuerySet API.

Adding a `Table.order_FOO` method (where `FOO` is the name of the column),
gives you the ability to chain to, or modify, the original queryset when that
column is selected to be ordered.

The method takes two arguments: `queryset`, and `is_descending`. The return
must be a tuple of two elements. The first being the queryset and the second
being a boolean; note that modified queryset will only be used if the boolean is
`True`.

For example, let's say instead of ordering alphabetically, ordering by
amount of characters in the first_name is desired.
The implementation would look like this:
::

    # tables.py
    from django.db.models.functions import Length

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

        def order_name(self, queryset, is_descending):
            queryset = queryset.annotate(
                length=Length('first_name')
            ).order_by(('-' if is_descending else '') + 'length')
            return (queryset, True)



As another example, presume the situation calls for being able to order by a
mathematical expression. In this scenario, the table needs to be able to be
ordered by the sum of both the shirts and the pants. The custom column will
have its value rendered using :ref:`table.render_FOO`.

This can be achieved like this::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        family_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        shirts = models.IntegerField()
        pants = models.IntegerField()


    # tables.py
    from django.db.models import F

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        clothing = tables.Column()

        class Meta:
            model = Person

        def render_clothing(self, record):
            return str(record.shirts + record.pants)

        def order_clothing(self, queryset, is_descending):
            queryset = queryset.annotate(
                amount=F('shirts') + F('pants')
            ).order_by(('-' if is_descending else '') + 'amount')
            return (queryset, True)

Class Based Generic Mixins
==========================

Django-tables2 comes with two class based view mixins: `.SingleTableMixin` and
`.MultiTableMixin`.


A single table using `.SingleTableMixin`
----------------------------------------

`.SingleTableMixin` makes it trivial to incorporate a table into a view or
template.

The following view parameters are supported:

- ``table_class`` –- the table class to use, e.g. ``SimpleTable``
- ``table_data`` (or ``get_table_data()``) -- the data used to populate the table
- ``context_table_name`` -- the name of template variable containing the table object
- ``table_pagination`` (or ``get_table_pagination``) -- pagination
  options to pass to `.RequestConfig`. Set ``table_pagination=False``
  to disable pagination.
- ``get_table_kwargs()`` allows the keyword arguments passed to the ``Table``
   constructor.

For example::

    from django_tables2 import SingleTableView


    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)


    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person


    class PersonList(SingleTableView):
        model = Person
        table_class = PersonTable


The template could then be as simple as:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% load render_table from django_tables2 %}
    {% render_table table %}

Such little code is possible due to the example above taking advantage of
default values and `.SingleTableMixin`'s eagerness at finding data sources
when one isn't explicitly defined.

.. note::

    You don't have to base your view on `ListView`, you're able to mix
    `SingleTableMixin` directly.


Multiple tables using `.MultipleObjectMixin`
--------------------------------------------

If you need more than one table in a single view you can use `MultiTableMixin`.
It manages multiple tables for you and takes care of adding the appropriate
prefixes for them. Just define a list of tables in the tables attribute::

    from django_tables2 import MultiTableMixin
    from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView

    class PersonTablesView(MultiTableMixin, TemplateView):
        template_name = 'multiTable.html'
        tables = [
            PersonTable(qs),
            PersonTable(qs, exclude=('country', ))
        ]

        table_pagination = {
            'per_page': 10
        }

In the template, you get a variable `tables`, which you can loop over like this:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% for table in tables %}
        {% render_table table %}
    {% endfor %}
</text>
</page>
<page>
<id>57</id>
<title>query-string-fields.rst.txt</title>
<text>
.. _query-string-fields:

Querystring fields
==================

Tables pass data via the querystring to indicate ordering and pagination
preferences.

The names of the querystring variables are configurable via the options:

- ``order_by_field`` -- default: ``'sort'``
- ``page_field`` -- default: ``'page'``
- ``per_page_field`` -- default: ``'per_page'``, **note:** this field currently
  isn't used by ``{% render_table %}``

Each of these can be specified in three places:

- ``Table.Meta.foo``
- ``Table(..., foo=...)``
- ``Table(...).foo = ...``

If you're using multiple tables on a single page, you'll want to prefix these
fields with a table-specific name, in order to prevent links on one table
interfere with those on another table::

    def people_listing(request):
        config = RequestConfig(request)
        table1 = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all(), prefix='1-')  # prefix specified
        table2 = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all(), prefix='2-')  # prefix specified
        config.configure(table1)
        config.configure(table2)

        return render(request, 'people_listing.html', {
            'table1': table1,
            'table2': table2
        })

<title>swapping-columns.txt</title>
<text>
.. _swapping-columns:

Swapping the position of columns
================================

By default columns are positioned in the same order as they are declared,
however when mixing auto-generated columns (via `Table.Meta.model`) with
manually declared columns, the column sequence becomes ambiguous.

To resolve the ambiguity, columns sequence can be declared via the
`.Table.Meta.sequence` option::

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        selection = tables.CheckBoxColumn(accessor='pk', orderable=False)

        class Meta:
            model = Person
            sequence = ('selection', 'first_name', 'last_name')

The special value ``'...'`` can be used to indicate that any omitted columns
should inserted at that location. As such it can be used at most once.

.. _tables-from-models:

Generating tables from models
=============================

If you build use tables to display `.QuerySet` data, rather than defining each
column manually in the table, the `.Table.Meta.model` option allows tables to
be dynamically created based on a model::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        dob = models.DateField()

    # tables.py
    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person

This has a number of benefits:

- Less code, easier to write, more DRY
- Columns use the field's `~.models.Field.verbose_name`
- Specialized columns are used where possible (e.g. `.DateColumn` for a
  `~.models.DateField`)

When using this approach, the following options are useful:

- `~.Table.Meta.sequence` -- reorder columns
- `~.Table.Meta.fields` -- specify model fields to *include*
- `~.Table.Meta.exclude` -- specify model fields to *exclude*

.. _table-data:

Populating a table with data
============================

Tables can be created from a range of input data structures. If you've seen the
tutorial you'll have seen a queryset being used, however any iterable that
supports :func:`len` and contains items that expose key-based access to column
values is fine.


List of dicts
-------------

An an example we will demonstrate using list of dicts. When defining a table
it is necessary to declare each column::

    import django_tables2 as tables

    data = [
        {'name': 'Bradley'},
        {'name': 'Stevie'},
    ]

    class NameTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

    table = NameTable(data)


Querysets
---------

If you build use tables to display `~django.db.models.query.QuerySet` data, rather than defining each
column manually in the table, the `.Table.Meta.model` option allows tables to
be dynamically created based on a model::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        dob = models.DateField()

    # tables.py
    import django_tables2 as tables

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person

    # views.py
    def person_list(request):
        table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())

        return render(request, 'person_list.html', {
            'table': table
        })

This has a number of benefits:

- Less repetition
- Column headers are defined using the field's `~.models.Field.verbose_name`
- Specialized columns are used where possible (e.g. `.DateColumn` for a
  `~.models.DateField`)

When using this approach, the following options might be useful to customize
what fields to show or hide:

- `~.Table.Meta.sequence` -- reorder columns
- `~.Table.Meta.fields` -- specify model fields to *include*
- `~.Table.Meta.exclude` -- specify model fields to *exclude*

.. _column-attributes:

Column attributes
=================

Column attributes can be specified using the `dict` with specific keys.
The dict defines HTML attributes for one of more elements within the column.
Depending on the column, different elements are supported, however ``th``,
``td``, and ``cell`` are supported universally::

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>>
    >>> class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
    ...     name = tables.Column(attrs={'th': {'id': 'foo'}})
    ...
    >>> # will render something like this:
    '{snip}<thead><tr><th id="foo" class="name">{snip}<tbody><tr><td class="name">{snip}'


For ``th`` and ``td``, the column name will be added as a class name. This makes
selecting the row for styling easier.
Have a look at each column's API reference to find which elements are supported.


.. _row-attributes:

Row attributes
==============

Row attributes can be specified using a dict defining the HTML attributes for
the ``<tr>`` element on each row. The values of the dict may be

By default, class names *odd* and *even* are supplied to the rows, wich can be
customized using the ``row_attrs`` `.Table.Meta` attribute or as argument to the
constructor of `.Table`, for example::

    class Table(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = User
            row_attrs = {
                'data-id': lambda record: record.pk
            }

will render tables with the following ``<tr>`` tag

.. sourcecode:: django

    <tr class="odd" data-id="1"> [...] </tr>
    <tr class="even" data-id="2"> [...] </tr>

API Reference
=============

`.Accessor` (`.A`)
------------------

.. autoclass:: django_tables2.utils.Accessor


`.RequestConfig`
----------------

.. autoclass:: django_tables2.config.RequestConfig


`.Table`
--------

.. autoclass:: django_tables2.tables.Table
    :members: paginate, as_html, get_column_class_names


`.Table.Meta`
-------------

.. class:: Table.Meta

    Provides a way to define *global* settings for table, as opposed to
    defining them for each instance.

    For example, if you want to create a table of users with their primary key
    added as a `data-id` attribute on each `<tr>`, You can use the following::

        class UsersTable(tables.Table):
            class Meta:
                row_attrs = {'data-id': lambda record: record.pk}

    Which adds the desired ``row_attrs`` to every instance of `UsersTable`, in
    contrast of defining it at construction time::

        table = tables.Table(User.objects.all(),
                             row_attrs={'data-id': lambda record: record.pk})

    Some settings are only available in `Table.Meta` and not as an argument to
    the `~.Table` constructor.

    .. Note::

        If you define a `class Meta` on a child of a table already having a
        `class Meta` defined, you need to specify the parent's `Meta` class as
        the parent for the `class Meta in the child`::

            class PersonTable(table.Table):
                class Meta:
                    model = Person
                    exclude = ('email', )

            class PersonWithEmailTable(PersonTable):
                class Meta(PersonTable.Meta):
                    exclude = ()

        All attributes are overwritten if defined in the child's `class Meta`,
        no merging is attempted.

    Arguments:
        attrs (`dict`): Add custom HTML attributes to the table.
            Allows custom HTML attributes to be specified which will be added to
            the ``<table>`` tag of any table rendered via :meth:`.Table.as_html`
            or the :ref:`template-tags.render_table` template tag.

            This is typically used to enable a theme for a table (which is done
            by adding a CSS class to the ``<table>`` element)::

                class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
                    name = tables.Column()

                    class Meta:
                        attrs = {'class': 'paleblue'}

            If you supply a a callable as a value in the dict, it will be called
            at table instatiation an de returned value will be used:

            Consider this example where each table gets an unieque ``"id"``
            attribute::

                import itertools
                counter = itertools.count()

                class UniqueIdTable(tables.Table):
                    name = tables.Column()

                    class Meta:
                        attrs = {'id': lambda: 'table_%d' % next(counter)}

            .. note::
                This functionality is also available via the ``attrs`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.


        row_attrs (`dict`): Add custom html attributes to the table rows.
            Allows custom HTML attributes to be specified which will be added
            to the ``<tr>`` tag of the rendered table.

            This can be used to add each record's primary key to each row::

                class PersonTable(tables.Table):
                    class Meta:
                        model = Person
                        row_attrs = {'data-id': lambda record: record.pk}

                # will result in
                '<tr data-id="1">...</tr>'

            .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

            .. note::

                This functionality is also available via the ``row_attrs`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.

        empty_text (str): Defines the text to display when the table has no rows.
            If the table is empty and ``bool(empty_text)`` is `True`, a row is
            displayed containing ``empty_text``. This is allows a message such as
            *There are currently no FOO.* to be displayed.

            .. note::

                This functionality is also available via the ``empty_text`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.

        show_header (bool): Wether or not to show the table header.
            Defines whether the table header should be displayed or not, by
            default, the header shows the column names.

            .. note::

                This functionality is also available via the ``show_header``
                keyword argument to a table's constructor.

        exclude (typle or str): Exclude columns from the table.
            This is useful in subclasses to exclude columns in a parent::

                >>> class Person(tables.Table):
                ...     first_name = tables.Column()
                ...     last_name = tables.Column()
                ...
                >>> Person.base_columns
                {'first_name': <django_tables2.columns.Column object at 0x10046df10>,
                'last_name': <django_tables2.columns.Column object at 0x10046d8d0>}
                >>> class ForgetfulPerson(Person):
                ...     class Meta:
                ...         exclude = ('last_name', )
                ...

                This functionality is also available via the ``exclude`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.

            However, unlike some of the other `.Table.Meta` options, providing the
            ``exclude`` keyword to a table's constructor **won't override** the
            `.Meta.exclude`. Instead, it will be effectively be *added*
            to it. i.e. you can't use the constructor's ``exclude`` argument to
            *undo* an exclusion.

    fields (`tuple` or `str`): Fields to show in the table.
        Used in conjunction with `~.Table.Meta.model`, specifies which fields
        should have columns in the table. If `None`, all fields are used,
        otherwise only those named::

            # models.py
            class Person(models.Model):
                first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
                last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

            # tables.py
            class PersonTable(tables.Table):
                class Meta:
                    model = Person
                    fields = ('first_name', )

    model (:class:`django.core.db.models.Model`): Create columns from model.
        A model to inspect and automatically create corresponding columns.

        This option allows a Django model to be specified to cause the table to
        automatically generate columns that correspond to the fields in a
        model.

    order_by (tuple or str): The default ordering tuple or comma separated str.
        A hyphen `-` can be used to prefix a column name to indicate
        *descending* order, for example: `('name', '-age')` or `name,-age`.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the ``order_by`` keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.

    sequence (iteralbe): The sequence of the table columns.
        This allows the default order of columns (the order they were defined
        in the Table) to be overridden.

        The special item `'...'` can be used as a placeholder that will be
        replaced with all the columns that weren't explicitly listed. This
        allows you to add columns to the front or back when using inheritance.

        Example::

            >>> class Person(tables.Table):
            ...     first_name = tables.Column()
            ...     last_name = tables.Column()
            ...
            ...     class Meta:
            ...         sequence = ('last_name', '...')
            ...
            >>> Person.base_columns.keys()
            ['last_name', 'first_name']

        The ``'...'`` item can be used at most once in the sequence value. If
        it's not used, every column *must* be explicitly included. e.g. in the
        above example, ``sequence = ('last_name', )`` would be **invalid**
        because neither ``'...'`` or ``'first_name'`` were included.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the ``sequence`` keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.

    orderable (bool): Default value for column's *orderable* attribute.
        If the table and column don't specify a value, a column's ``orderable``
        value will fallback to this. This provides an easy mechanism to disable
        ordering on an entire table, without adding ``orderable=False`` to each
        column in a table.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the ``orderable`` keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.

    template (str): The default template to use when rendering the table.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the *template* keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.


    localize (str or tuple): Specifies which fields should be localized in the
        table. Read :ref:`localization-control` for more information.

    unlocalize (str or tuple): Specifies which fields should be unlocalized in
        the table. Read :ref:`localization-control` for more information.

.. _accessors:

Alternative column data
=======================

Various options are available for changing the way the table is :term:`rendered
<render>`. Each approach has a different balance of ease-of-use and
flexibility.


Using `~.Accessors`
-------------------

Each column has a 'key' that describes which value to pull from each record to
populate the column's cells. By default, this key is just the name given to the
column, but it can be changed to allow foreign key traversal or other complex
cases.

To reduce ambiguity, rather than calling it a 'key', we use the name 'accessor'.

Accessors are just dotted paths that describe how an object should be traversed
to reach a specific value, for example::

    >>> from django_tables2 import A
    >>> data = {'abc': {'one': {'two': 'three'}}}
    >>> A('abc.one.two').resolve(data)
    'three'

Dots represent a relationships, and are attempted in this order:

1. Dictionary lookup ``a[b]``
2. Attribute lookup ``a.b``
3. List index lookup ``a[int(b)]``

If the resulting value is callable, it is called and the return value is used.

.. _table.render_foo:

`Table.render_foo` methods
------------------------------------

To change how a column is rendered, define a ``render_foo`` method on
the table for example: `render_row_number()` for a column named `row_number`.
This approach is suitable if you have a one-off change that you do not want to
use in multiple tables.

Supported keyword arguments include:

- ``record`` -- the entire record for the row from the :term:`table data`
- ``value`` -- the value for the cell retrieved from the :term:`table data`
- ``column`` -- the `.Column` object
- ``bound_column`` -- the `.BoundColumn` object
- ``bound_row`` -- the `.BoundRow` object
- ``table`` -- alias for ``self``

This example shows how to render the row number in the first row::

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>> import itertools
    >>> class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
    ...     row_number = tables.Column(empty_values=())
    ...     id = tables.Column()
    ...     age = tables.Column()
    ...
    ...     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    ...         super(SimpleTable, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    ...         self.counter = itertools.count()
    ...
    ...     def render_row_number(self):
    ...         return 'Row %d' % next(self.counter)
    ...
    ...     def render_id(self, value):
    ...         return '<%s>' % value
    ...
    >>> table = SimpleTable([{'age': 31, 'id': 10}, {'age': 34, 'id': 11}])
    >>> print ', '.join(map(str, table.rows[0]))
    Row 0, <10>, 31

Python's `inspect.getargspec` is used to only pass the arguments declared by the
function. This means it's not necessary to add a catch all (``**``) keyword
argument.

.. important::

    `render` methods are *only* called if the value for a cell is determined to
    be not an :term:`empty value`. When a value is in `.Column.empty_values`,
    a default value is rendered instead (both `.Column.render` and
    ``Table.render_FOO`` are skipped).

.. _subclassing-column:

Subclassing `.Column`
---------------------

Defining a column subclass allows functionality to be reused across tables.
Columns have a `render` method that behaves the same as :ref:`table.render_foo`
methods on tables::

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>>
    >>> class UpperColumn(tables.Column):
    ...     def render(self, value):
    ...         return value.upper()
    ...
    >>> class Example(tables.Table):
    ...     normal = tables.Column()
    ...     upper = UpperColumn()
    ...
    >>> data = [{'normal': 'Hi there!',
    ...          'upper':  'Hi there!'}]
    ...
    >>> table = Example(data)
    >>> # renders to something like this:
    '''<table>
        <thead><tr><th>Normal</th><th>Upper</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td>Hi there!</td><td>HI THERE!</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>'''

See :ref:`table.render_foo` for a list of arguments that can be accepted.

For complicated columns, you may want to return HTML from the
:meth:`~Column.render` method. Make sure to use Django's html formatting functions::

    >>> from django.utils.html import format_html
    >>>
    >>> class ImageColumn(tables.Column):
    ...     def render(self, value):
    ...         return format_html('<img src="/media/img/{}.jpg" />', value)
    ...

Alternative column ordering
===========================

When using queryset data, one might want to show a computed value which is not
in the database. In this case, attempting to order the column will cause an
exception::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        family_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

        @property
        def name(self):
            return '{} {}'.format(self.first_name, self.family_name)

    # tables.py
    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

::

    >>> table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())
    >>> table.order_by = 'name'
    >>>
    >>> # will result in:
    FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'name' into field. Choices are: first_name, family_name

To prevent this, django-tables2 allows two ways to specify custom ordering:
accessors and :meth:`~.order_FOO` methods.

.. _order-by-accessors:

Ordering by accessors
---------------------

You can supply an ``order_by`` argument containing a name or a tuple of the
names of the columns the database should use to sort it::

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column(order_by=('first_name', 'family_name'))

`~.Accessor` syntax can be used as well, as long as they point to a model field.

If ordering does not make sense for a particular column, it can be disabled via
the ``orderable`` argument::

    class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()
        actions = tables.Column(orderable=False)


.. _table.order_foo:

:meth:`table.order_FOO` methods
--------------------------------

Another solution for alternative ordering is being able to chain functions on to
the original queryset. This method allows more complex functionality giving the
ability to use all of Django's QuerySet API.

Adding a `Table.order_FOO` method (where `FOO` is the name of the column),
gives you the ability to chain to, or modify, the original queryset when that
column is selected to be ordered.

The method takes two arguments: `queryset`, and `is_descending`. The return
must be a tuple of two elements. The first being the queryset and the second
being a boolean; note that modified queryset will only be used if the boolean is
`True`.

For example, let's say instead of ordering alphabetically, ordering by
amount of characters in the first_name is desired.
The implementation would look like this:
::

    # tables.py
    from django.db.models.functions import Length

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

        def order_name(self, queryset, is_descending):
            queryset = queryset.annotate(
                length=Length('first_name')
            ).order_by(('-' if is_descending else '') + 'length')
            return (queryset, True)



As another example, presume the situation calls for being able to order by a
mathematical expression. In this scenario, the table needs to be able to be
ordered by the sum of both the shirts and the pants. The custom column will
have its value rendered using :ref:`table.render_FOO`.

This can be achieved like this::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        family_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        shirts = models.IntegerField()
        pants = models.IntegerField()


    # tables.py
    from django.db.models import F

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        clothing = tables.Column()

        class Meta:
            model = Person

        def render_clothing(self, record):
            return str(record.shirts + record.pants)

        def order_clothing(self, queryset, is_descending):
            queryset = queryset.annotate(
                amount=F('shirts') + F('pants')
            ).order_by(('-' if is_descending else '') + 'amount')
            return (queryset, True)

.. _table-data:

Populating a table with data
============================

Tables can be created from a range of input data structures. If you've seen the
tutorial you'll have seen a queryset being used, however any iterable that
supports :func:`len` and contains items that expose key-based access to column
values is fine.


List of dicts
-------------

An an example we will demonstrate using list of dicts. When defining a table
it is necessary to declare each column::

    import django_tables2 as tables

    data = [
        {'name': 'Bradley'},
        {'name': 'Stevie'},
    ]

    class NameTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

    table = NameTable(data)


Querysets
---------

If you build use tables to display `~django.db.models.query.QuerySet` data, rather than defining each
column manually in the table, the `.Table.Meta.model` option allows tables to
be dynamically created based on a model::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User')
        dob = models.DateField()

    # tables.py
    import django_tables2 as tables

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person

    # views.py
    def person_list(request):
        table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())

        return render(request, 'person_list.html', {
            'table': table
        })

This has a number of benefits:

- Less repetition
- Column headers are defined using the field's `~.models.Field.verbose_name`
- Specialized columns are used where possible (e.g. `.DateColumn` for a
  `~.models.DateField`)

When using this approach, the following options might be useful to customize
what fields to show or hide:

- `~.Table.Meta.sequence` -- reorder columns
- `~.Table.Meta.fields` -- specify model fields to *include*
- `~.Table.Meta.exclude` -- specify model fields to *exclude*

FAQ
===

Some frequently requested questions/examples. All examples assume you
import django-tables2 like this::

    import django_tables2 as tables

How should I fix error messages about the request context processor?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The error message looks something like this::

    Tag {% querystring %} requires django.template.context_processors.request to be
    in the template configuration in settings.TEMPLATES[]OPTIONS.context_processors)
    in order for the included template tags to function correctly.

which should be pretty clear, but here is an example template configuration anyway::

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': ['templates'],
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    'django.template.context_processors.static',
                ],
            }
        }
    ]

How to create a row counter?
----------------------------

You can use `itertools.counter` to add row count to a table. Note that in a
paginated table, every page's counter will start at zero.

Use a `render_counter()`-method::

    import itertools

    class CountryTable(tables.Table):
        counter = tables.Column(empty_values=(), orderable=False)

        def render_counter(self):
            self.row_counter = getattr(self, 'row_counter', itertools.count())
            return next(self.row_counter)



Or create a specialized column::

    import itertools

    class CounterColumn(tables.Column):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.counter = itertools.count()
            kwargs.update({
                'empty_values': (),
                'orderable': False
            })
            super(CounterColumn, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        def render(self):
            return next(self.counter)


How to add a footer containing a column total?
----------------------------------------------

Using the `footer`-argument to `~.Column`::

    class CountryTable(tables.Table):
        population = tables.Column(
            footer=lambda table: sum(x['population'] for x in table.data)
        )

Or by creating a custom column::

    class SummingColumn(tables.Column):
        def render_footer(self, bound_column, table):
            return sum(bound_column.accessor.resolve(row) for row in table.data)

    class Table(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column(footer='Total:')
        population = SummingColumn()

Documentation: :ref:`column-footers`

.. note ::
    Your table template must include a block rendering the table footer!


Can I use inheritance to build Tables that share features?
----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, like this::

    class CountryTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()
        language = tables.Column()

A `CountryTable` will show columns `name` and `language`.

    class TouristCountryTable(CountryTable):
        tourist_info = tables.Column()

A `TouristCountryTable` will show columns `name`, `language` and `tourist_info`.

Overwriting a Column attribute from the base class with anything that is not a Column will result in removing that Column from the Table. For example:

    class SimpleCountryTable(CountryTable):
        language = None

A `SimpleCountryTable` will only show column `name`.

Table Mixins
============

It's possible to create a mixin for a table that overrides something, however
unless it itself is a subclass of `.Table` class variable instances of
`.Column` will **not** be added to the class which is using the mixin.

Example::

    >>> class UselessMixin(object):
    ...     extra = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> class TestTable(UselessMixin, tables.Table):
    ...     name = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> TestTable.base_columns.keys()
    ['name']

To have a mixin contribute a column, it needs to be a subclass of
`~django_tables2.tables.Table`. With this in mind the previous example
*should* have been written as follows::

    >>> class UsefulMixin(tables.Table):
    ...     extra = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> class TestTable(UsefulMixin, tables.Table):
    ...     name = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> TestTable.base_columns.keys()
    ['extra', 'name']

Performance
-----------

Django-tables tries to be efficient in displaying big datasets. It tries to
avoid converting the `~django.db.models.query.QuerySet` instances to lists by
using SQL to slice the data and should be able to handle datasets with 100k
records without a problem.

However, when using one of the customisation methods described in this
documentation, there is lot's of oppurtunity to introduce slowness.
If you experience that, try to strip the table of customisations and re-add them
one by one, checking for performance after each step.

.. _localization-control:

Controlling localization
========================

Django-tables2 allows you to define which column of a table should or should not
be localized. For example you may want to use this feature in following use cases:

* You want to format some columns representing for example numeric values in the given locales
  even if you don't enable `USE_L10N` in your settings file.

* You don't want to format primary key values in your table
  even if you enabled `USE_L10N` in your settings file.

This control is done by using two filter functions in Django's `l10n` library
named `localize` and `unlocalize`. Check out Django docs about
`localization <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/i18n/formatting/>` for more information about them.

There are two ways of controlling localization in your columns.

First one is setting the `~.Column.localize` attribute in your column definition
to `True` or `False`. Like so::

     class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        id = tables.Column(name='id', accessor='pk', localize=False)
        class Meta:
            model = Person


.. note::
    The default value of the `localize` attribute is `None` which means the formatting
    of columns is dependant from the `USE_L10N` setting.

The second way is to define a `~.Table.Meta.localize` and/or `~.Table.Meta.unlocalize`
tuples in your tables Meta class (jutst like with `~.Table.Meta.fields`
or `~.Table.Meta.exclude`). You can do this like so::

     class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        id = tables.Column(accessor='pk')
        value = tables.Column(accessor='some_numerical_field')
        class Meta:
            model = Person
            unlocalize = ('id', )
            localize = ('value', )

If you define the same column in both `localize` and `unlocalize` then the value
of this column will be 'unlocalized' which means that `unlocalize` has higher precedence.

FAQ
===

Some frequently requested questions/examples. All examples assume you
import django-tables2 like this::

    import django_tables2 as tables

How should I fix error messages about the request context processor?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The error message looks something like this::

    Tag {% querystring %} requires django.template.context_processors.request to be
    in the template configuration in settings.TEMPLATES[]OPTIONS.context_processors)
    in order for the included template tags to function correctly.

which should be pretty clear, but here is an example template configuration anyway::

    TEMPLATES = [
        {
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': ['templates'],
            'APP_DIRS': True,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'context_processors': [
                    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                    'django.template.context_processors.request',
                    'django.template.context_processors.static',
                ],
            }
        }
    ]

How to create a row counter?
----------------------------

You can use `itertools.counter` to add row count to a table. Note that in a
paginated table, every page's counter will start at zero.

Use a `render_counter()`-method::

    import itertools

    class CountryTable(tables.Table):
        counter = tables.Column(empty_values=(), orderable=False)

        def render_counter(self):
            self.row_counter = getattr(self, 'row_counter', itertools.count())
            return next(self.row_counter)



Or create a specialized column::

    import itertools

    class CounterColumn(tables.Column):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            self.counter = itertools.count()
            kwargs.update({
                'empty_values': (),
                'orderable': False
            })
            super(CounterColumn, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        def render(self):
            return next(self.counter)


How to add a footer containing a column total?
----------------------------------------------

Using the `footer`-argument to `~.Column`::

    class CountryTable(tables.Table):
        population = tables.Column(
            footer=lambda table: sum(x['population'] for x in table.data)
        )

Or by creating a custom column::

    class SummingColumn(tables.Column):
        def render_footer(self, bound_column, table):
            return sum(bound_column.accessor.resolve(row) for row in table.data)

    class Table(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column(footer='Total:')
        population = SummingColumn()

Documentation: :ref:`column-footers`

.. note ::
    Your table template must include a block rendering the table footer!


Can I use inheritance to build Tables that share features?
----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, like this::

    class CountryTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()
        language = tables.Column()

A `CountryTable` will show columns `name` and `language`.

    class TouristCountryTable(CountryTable):
        tourist_info = tables.Column()

A `TouristCountryTable` will show columns `name`, `language` and `tourist_info`.

Overwriting a Column attribute from the base class with anything that is not a Column will result in removing that Column from the Table. For example:

    class SimpleCountryTable(CountryTable):
        language = None

A `SimpleCountryTable` will only show column `name`.

.. _template_tags:

Template tags
=============

.. _template-tags.render_table:

render_table
------------

Renders a `~django_tables2.tables.Table` object to HTML and enables as
many features in the output as possible.

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% load django_tables2 %}
    {% render_table table %}

    {# Alternatively a specific template can be used #}
    {% render_table table "path/to/custom_table_template.html" %}

If the second argument (template path) is given, the template will be rendered
with a `.RequestContext` and the table will be in the variable ``table``.

.. note::

    This tag temporarily modifies the `.Table` object during rendering. A
    ``context`` attribute is added to the table, providing columns with access
    to the current context for their own rendering (e.g. `.TemplateColumn`).

This tag requires that the template in which it's rendered contains the
`~.http.HttpRequest` inside a ``request`` variable. This can be achieved by
ensuring the ``TEMPLATES[]['OPTIONS']['context_processors']`` setting contains
``django.template.context_processors.request``.
Please refer to the Django documentation for the TEMPLATES-setting_.

.. _TEMPLATES-setting: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-TEMPLATES

.. _template-tags.querystring:

querystring
-----------

A utility that allows you to update a portion of the query-string without
overwriting the entire thing.

Let's assume we have the querystring ``?search=pirates&sort=name&page=5`` and
we want to update the ``sort`` parameter:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% querystring "sort"="dob" %}           # ?search=pirates&sort=dob&page=5
    {% querystring "sort"="" %}              # ?search=pirates&page=5
    {% querystring "sort"="" "search"="" %}  # ?page=5

    {% with "search" as key %}               # supports variables as keys
    {% querystring key="robots" %}           # ?search=robots&page=5
    {% endwith %}

This tag requires the ``django.template.context_processors.request`` context
processor, see :ref:`template-tags.render_table`.

Class Based Generic Mixins
==========================

Django-tables2 comes with two class based view mixins: `.SingleTableMixin` and
`.MultiTableMixin`.


A single table using `.SingleTableMixin`
----------------------------------------

`.SingleTableMixin` makes it trivial to incorporate a table into a view or
template.

The following view parameters are supported:

- ``table_class`` –- the table class to use, e.g. ``SimpleTable``
- ``table_data`` (or ``get_table_data()``) -- the data used to populate the table
- ``context_table_name`` -- the name of template variable containing the table object
- ``table_pagination`` (or ``get_table_pagination``) -- pagination
  options to pass to `.RequestConfig`. Set ``table_pagination=False``
  to disable pagination.
- ``get_table_kwargs()`` allows the keyword arguments passed to the ``Table``
   constructor.

For example::

    from django_tables2 import SingleTableView


    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)


    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person


    class PersonList(SingleTableView):
        model = Person
        table_class = PersonTable


The template could then be as simple as:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% load render_table from django_tables2 %}
    {% render_table table %}

Such little code is possible due to the example above taking advantage of
default values and `.SingleTableMixin`'s eagerness at finding data sources
when one isn't explicitly defined.

.. note::

    You don't have to base your view on `ListView`, you're able to mix
    `SingleTableMixin` directly.


Multiple tables using `.MultipleObjectMixin`
--------------------------------------------

If you need more than one table in a single view you can use `MultiTableMixin`.
It manages multiple tables for you and takes care of adding the appropriate
prefixes for them. Just define a list of tables in the tables attribute::

    from django_tables2 import MultiTableMixin
    from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView

    class PersonTablesView(MultiTableMixin, TemplateView):
        template_name = 'multiTable.html'
        tables = [
            PersonTable(qs),
            PersonTable(qs, exclude=('country', ))
        ]

        table_pagination = {
            'per_page': 10
        }

In the template, you get a variable `tables`, which you can loop over like this:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% for table in tables %}
        {% render_table table %}
    {% endfor %}

.. _builtin-columns:

Built-in columns
================

For common use-cases the following columns are included:

- `.BooleanColumn` -- renders boolean values
- `.Column` -- generic column
- `.CheckBoxColumn` -- renders checkbox form inputs
- `.DateColumn` -- date formatting
- `.DateTimeColumn` -- datetime formatting in the local timezone
- `.FileColumn` -- renders files as links
- `.EmailColumn` -- renders ``<a href="mailto:...">`` tags
- `.LinkColumn` -- renders ``<a href="...">`` tags (compose a django url)
- `.RelatedLinkColumn` -- renders ``<a href="...">`` tags linking related objects
- `.TemplateColumn` -- renders template code
- `.URLColumn` -- renders ``<a href="...">`` tags (absolute url)

## v0.15.0
- Add UK, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Polish translations
- Add support for computed table `attrs`.

## v0.14.0

- Add Travis CI support
- Add support for Django 1.5
- Add L10N control for columns #120 (ignored in < Django 1.3)
- Drop Python 2.6.4 support in favour of Python 3.2 support
- Non-queryset data ordering is different between Python 3 and 2. When comparing different types, their truth values are now compared before falling back to string representations of their type.

## v0.13.0
- Add FileColumn.

## v0.12.1
- When resolving an accessor, *all* exceptions are smothered into `None`.

## v0.12.0
 - Improve performance by removing unnecessary queries
 - Simplified pagination:
    - `Table.page` is an instance attribute (no longer `@property`)
    - Exceptions raised by paginators (e.g. `EmptyPage`) are no longer
      smothered by `Table.page`
    - Pagination exceptions are raised by `Table.paginate`
    - `RequestConfig` can handles pagination errors silently, can be disabled
      by including `silent=False` in the `paginate` argument value
 - Add `DateTimeColumn` and `DateColumn` to handle formatting `datetime`
   and timezones.
 - Add `BooleanColumn` to handle bool values
 - `render_table` can now build and render a table for a queryset, rather than
   needing to be passed a table instance
 - Table columns created automatically from a model now use specialised columns
 - `Column.render` is now skipped if the value is considered *empty*, the
   default value is used instead. Empty values are specified via
   `Column.empty_values`, by default is `(None, '')` (backward incompatible)
 - Default values can now be specified on table instances or `Table.Meta`
 - Accessor's now honor `alters_data` during resolving. Fixes issue that would
   delete all your data when a column had an accessor of `delete`
 - Add `default` and `value` to context of `TemplateColumn`
 - Add cardinality indication to the pagination area of a table
 - `Attrs` is deprecated, use `dict` instead

## v0.11.0
 - Add `URLColumn` to render URLs in a data source into hyperlinks
 - Add `EmailColumn` to render email addresses into hyperlinks
 - `TemplateColumn` can now Django's template loaders to render from a file

## v0.10.4
 - Fix more bugs on Python 2.6.4, all tests now pass.

## v0.10.3
 - Fix issues for Python 2.6.4 -- thanks Steve Sapovits & brianmay
 - Reduce Django 1.3 dependency to Table.as_html -- thanks brianmay

## v0.10.2
 - Fix MANIFEST.in to include example templates, thanks TWAC.
 - Upgrade django-attest to fix problem with tests on Django 1.3.1

## v0.10.1
 - Fixed support for Django 1.4's paginator (thanks koledennix)
 - Some juggling of internal implementation.
   `TableData` now supports slicing and returns new `TableData` instances.
   `BoundRows` now takes a single argument `data` (a `TableData` instance).
 - Add support for `get_pagination` on `SingleTableMixin`.
 - `SingleTableMixin` and `SingleTableView` are now importable directly from `django_tables2`.

## v0.10.0
 - Renamed `BoundColumn.order_by` to `order_by_alias` and never returns `None`
   (**Backwards incompatible**). Templates are affected if they use something like:

       {% querystring table.prefixed_order_by_field=column.order_by.opposite|default:column.name %}

   Which should be rewritten as:

       {% querystring table.prefixed_order_by_field=column.order_by_alias.next %}

 - Added `next` shortcut to `OrderBy` returned from `BoundColumn.order_by_alias`
 - Added `OrderByTuple.get()`
 - Deprecated `BoundColumn.sortable`, `Column.sortable`, `Table.sortable`,
   `sortable` CSS class, `BoundColumns.itersortable`, `BoundColumns.sortable`; use `orderable` instead of `sortable`.
 - Added `BoundColumn.is_ordered`
 - Introduced concept of an `order by alias`, see glossary in the docs for details.

## v0.9.6
 - Fix bug that caused an ordered column's th to have no HTML attributes.

## v0.9.5
 - Updated example project to add colspan on footer cell so table border renders correctly in Webkit.
 - Fix regression that caused 'sortable' class on <th>.
 - Table.__init__ no longer *always* calls .order_by() on querysets, fixes #55.
   This does introduce a slight backwards incompatibility. `Table.order_by` now has the possibility of returning `None`, previously it would *always* return an `OrderByTuple`.
 - DeclarativeColumnsMetaclass.__new__ now uses super()
 - Testing now requires pylint and Attest >=0.5.3

## v0.9.4
 - Fix regression that caused column verbose_name values that were marked as
   safe to be escaped. Now any verbose_name values that are instances of
   SafeData are used unmodified.

## v0.9.3
 - Fix regression in `SingleTableMixin`.
 - Remove stray `print` statement.

## v0.9.2
 - `SingleTableView` now uses `RequestConfig`. This fixes issues with
   `order_by_field`, `page_field`, and `per_page_field` not being honored.
 - Add `Table.Meta.per_page` and change `Table.paginate` to use it as default.
 - Add `title` template filter. It differs from Django's built-in `title` filter
   because it operates on an individual word basis and leaves words containing
   capitals untouched. **Warning**: use `{% load ... from ... %}` to avoid
   inadvertantly replacing Django's builtin `title` template filter.
 - `BoundColumn.verbose_name` no longer does `capfirst`, titlising is now the
   responsbility of `Column.header`.
 - `BoundColumn.__unicode__` now uses `BoundColumn.header` rather than
   `BoundColumn.verbose_name`.

## v0.9.1
 - Fix version in setup.py (doh)

## v0.9.0
 - Add support for column attributes (see Attrs)
 - Add BoundRows.items() to yield (bound_column, cell) pairs
 - Tried to make docs more concise. Much stronger promotion of using
   RequestConfig and {% querystring %}

## v0.8.4
 - Removed random 'print' statements.
 - Tweaked 'paleblue' theme css to be more flexible:
   - removed `whitespace: no-wrap`
   - header background image to support more than 2 rows of text

## v0.8.3
 - Fixed stupid import mistake. Tests didn't pick it up due to them ignoring `ImportError`.

## v0.8.2
 - `SingleTableView` now inherits from `ListView` which enables automatic
   `foo_list.html` template name resolution (thanks dramon for reporting)
 - `render_table` template tag no suppresses exceptions when `DEBUG=True`

## v0.8.1
 - Fixed bug in render_table when giving it a template (issue #41)

## v0.8.0
 - Added translation support in the default template via `{% trans %}`
 - Removed `basic_table.html`, `Table.as_html()` now renders `table.html` but
   will clobber the querystring of the current request. Use the `render_table`
   template tag instead
 - `render_table` now supports an optional second argument -- the template to
   use when rendering the table
 - `Table` now supports declaring which template to use when rendering to HTML
 - Django >=1.3 is now required
 - Added support for using django-haystack's `SearchQuerySet` as a data source
 - The default template `table.html` now includes block tags to make it easy to
   extend to change small pieces
 - Fixed table template parsing problems being hidden due to a subsequent
   exception being raised
 - Http404 exceptions are no longer raised during a call to `Table.paginate()`,
   instead it now occurs when `Table.page` is accessed
 - Fixed bug where a table couldn't be rendered more than once if it was
   paginated
 - Accessing `Table.page` now returns a new page every time, rather than reusing
   a single object

## v0.7.8
 - Tables now support using both `sequence` and `exclude` (issue #32).
 - `Sequence` class moved to `django_tables2/utils.py`.
 - Table instances now support modification to the `exclude` property.
 - Removed `BoundColumns._spawn_columns`.
 - `Table.data`, `Table.rows`, and `Table.columns` are now attributes
   rather than properties.

Table Mixins
============

It's possible to create a mixin for a table that overrides something, however
unless it itself is a subclass of `.Table` class variable instances of
`.Column` will **not** be added to the class which is using the mixin.

Example::

    >>> class UselessMixin(object):
    ...     extra = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> class TestTable(UselessMixin, tables.Table):
    ...     name = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> TestTable.base_columns.keys()
    ['name']

To have a mixin contribute a column, it needs to be a subclass of
`~django_tables2.tables.Table`. With this in mind the previous example
*should* have been written as follows::

    >>> class UsefulMixin(tables.Table):
    ...     extra = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> class TestTable(UsefulMixin, tables.Table):
    ...     name = tables.Column()
    ...
    >>> TestTable.base_columns.keys()
    ['extra', 'name']

Glossary

.. glossary::

    accessor
        Refers to an `.Accessor` object

    column name
        The name given to a column. In the follow example, the *column name* is
        ``age``.

        .. sourcecode:: python

            class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
                age = tables.Column()

    empty value
        An empty value is synonymous with "no value". Columns have an
        ``empty_values`` attribute that contains values that are considered
        empty. It's a way to declare which values from the database correspond
        to *null*/*blank*/*missing* etc.

    order by alias
        A prefixed column name that describes how a column should impact the
        order of data within the table. This allows the implementation of how
        a column affects ordering to be abstracted, which is useful (e.g. in
        querystrings).

        .. sourcecode:: python

            class ExampleTable(tables.Table):
                name = tables.Column(order_by=('first_name', 'last_name'))

        In this example ``-name`` and ``name`` are valid order by aliases. In
        a querystring you might then have ``?order=-name``.

    table
        The traditional concept of a table. i.e. a grid of rows and columns
        containing data.

    view
        A Django view.

    record
        A single Python object used as the data for a single row.

    render
        The act of serializing a `.Table` into
        HTML.

    template
        A Django template.

    table data
        An interable of :term:`records <record>` that
        `.Table` uses to populate its rows.

API Reference
=============

`.Accessor` (`.A`)
------------------

.. autoclass:: django_tables2.utils.Accessor


`.RequestConfig`
----------------

.. autoclass:: django_tables2.config.RequestConfig


`.Table`
--------

.. autoclass:: django_tables2.tables.Table
    :members: paginate, as_html, as_values, get_column_class_names


`.Table.Meta`
-------------

.. class:: Table.Meta

    Provides a way to define *global* settings for table, as opposed to
    defining them for each instance.

    For example, if you want to create a table of users with their primary key
    added as a `data-id` attribute on each `<tr>`, You can use the following::

        class UsersTable(tables.Table):
            class Meta:
                row_attrs = {'data-id': lambda record: record.pk}

    Which adds the desired ``row_attrs`` to every instance of `UsersTable`, in
    contrast of defining it at construction time::

        table = tables.Table(User.objects.all(),
                             row_attrs={'data-id': lambda record: record.pk})

    Some settings are only available in `Table.Meta` and not as an argument to
    the `~.Table` constructor.

    .. Note::

        If you define a `class Meta` on a child of a table already having a
        `class Meta` defined, you need to specify the parent's `Meta` class as
        the parent for the `class Meta in the child`::

            class PersonTable(table.Table):
                class Meta:
                    model = Person
                    exclude = ('email', )

            class PersonWithEmailTable(PersonTable):
                class Meta(PersonTable.Meta):
                    exclude = ()

        All attributes are overwritten if defined in the child's `class Meta`,
        no merging is attempted.

    Arguments:
        attrs (`dict`): Add custom HTML attributes to the table.
            Allows custom HTML attributes to be specified which will be added to
            the ``<table>`` tag of any table rendered via :meth:`.Table.as_html`
            or the :ref:`template-tags.render_table` template tag.

            This is typically used to enable a theme for a table (which is done
            by adding a CSS class to the ``<table>`` element)::

                class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
                    name = tables.Column()

                    class Meta:
                        attrs = {'class': 'paleblue'}

            If you supply a a callable as a value in the dict, it will be called
            at table instatiation an de returned value will be used:

            Consider this example where each table gets an unieque ``"id"``
            attribute::

                import itertools
                counter = itertools.count()

                class UniqueIdTable(tables.Table):
                    name = tables.Column()

                    class Meta:
                        attrs = {'id': lambda: 'table_%d' % next(counter)}

            .. note::
                This functionality is also available via the ``attrs`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.


        row_attrs (`dict`): Add custom html attributes to the table rows.
            Allows custom HTML attributes to be specified which will be added
            to the ``<tr>`` tag of the rendered table.

            This can be used to add each record's primary key to each row::

                class PersonTable(tables.Table):
                    class Meta:
                        model = Person
                        row_attrs = {'data-id': lambda record: record.pk}

                # will result in
                '<tr data-id="1">...</tr>'

            .. versionadded:: 1.2.0

            .. note::

                This functionality is also available via the ``row_attrs`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.

        empty_text (str): Defines the text to display when the table has no rows.
            If the table is empty and ``bool(empty_text)`` is `True`, a row is
            displayed containing ``empty_text``. This is allows a message such as
            *There are currently no FOO.* to be displayed.

            .. note::

                This functionality is also available via the ``empty_text`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.

        show_header (bool): Wether or not to show the table header.
            Defines whether the table header should be displayed or not, by
            default, the header shows the column names.

            .. note::

                This functionality is also available via the ``show_header``
                keyword argument to a table's constructor.

        exclude (typle or str): Exclude columns from the table.
            This is useful in subclasses to exclude columns in a parent::

                >>> class Person(tables.Table):
                ...     first_name = tables.Column()
                ...     last_name = tables.Column()
                ...
                >>> Person.base_columns
                {'first_name': <django_tables2.columns.Column object at 0x10046df10>,
                'last_name': <django_tables2.columns.Column object at 0x10046d8d0>}
                >>> class ForgetfulPerson(Person):
                ...     class Meta:
                ...         exclude = ('last_name', )
                ...
                >>> ForgetfulPerson.base_columns
                {'first_name': <django_tables2.columns.Column object at 0x10046df10>}

            .. note::

                This functionality is also available via the ``exclude`` keyword
                argument to a table's constructor.

            However, unlike some of the other `.Table.Meta` options, providing the
            ``exclude`` keyword to a table's constructor **won't override** the
            `.Meta.exclude`. Instead, it will be effectively be *added*
            to it. i.e. you can't use the constructor's ``exclude`` argument to
            *undo* an exclusion.

    fields (`tuple` or `str`): Fields to show in the table.
        Used in conjunction with `~.Table.Meta.model`, specifies which fields
        should have columns in the table. If `None`, all fields are used,
        otherwise only those named::

            # models.py
            class Person(models.Model):
                first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
                last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

            # tables.py
            class PersonTable(tables.Table):
                class Meta:
                    model = Person
                    fields = ('first_name', )

    model (:class:`django.core.db.models.Model`): Create columns from model.
        A model to inspect and automatically create corresponding columns.

        This option allows a Django model to be specified to cause the table to
        automatically generate columns that correspond to the fields in a
        model.

    order_by (tuple or str): The default ordering tuple or comma separated str.
        A hyphen `-` can be used to prefix a column name to indicate
        *descending* order, for example: `('name', '-age')` or `name,-age`.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the ``order_by`` keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.

    sequence (iteralbe): The sequence of the table columns.
        This allows the default order of columns (the order they were defined
        in the Table) to be overridden.

        The special item `'...'` can be used as a placeholder that will be
        replaced with all the columns that weren't explicitly listed. This
        allows you to add columns to the front or back when using inheritance.

        Example::

            >>> class Person(tables.Table):
            ...     first_name = tables.Column()
            ...     last_name = tables.Column()
            ...
            ...     class Meta:
            ...         sequence = ('last_name', '...')
            ...
            >>> Person.base_columns.keys()
            ['last_name', 'first_name']

        The ``'...'`` item can be used at most once in the sequence value. If
        it's not used, every column *must* be explicitly included. e.g. in the
        above example, ``sequence = ('last_name', )`` would be **invalid**
        because neither ``'...'`` or ``'first_name'`` were included.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the ``sequence`` keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.

    orderable (bool): Default value for column's *orderable* attribute.
        If the table and column don't specify a value, a column's ``orderable``
        value will fallback to this. This provides an easy mechanism to disable
        ordering on an entire table, without adding ``orderable=False`` to each
        column in a table.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the ``orderable`` keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.

    template (str): The default template to use when rendering the table.

        .. note::

            This functionality is also available via the *template* keyword
            argument to a table's constructor.


    localize (str or tuple): Specifies which fields should be localized in the
        table. Read :ref:`localization-control` for more information.

    unlocalize (str or tuple): Specifies which fields should be unlocalized in
        the table. Read :ref:`localization-control` for more information.

## v0.15.0
- Add UK, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Polish translations

- Add support for Django 1.5
- Add L10N control for columns #120 (ignored in < Django 1.3)
- Drop Python 2.6.4 support in favour of Python 3.2 support
- Non-queryset data ordering is different between Python 3 and 2. When comparing different types, their truth values are now compared before falling back to string representations of their type.

## v0.13.0
- Add FileColumn.

## v0.12.1
- When resolving an accessor, *all* exceptions are smothered into `None`.

## v0.12.0
 - Improve performance by removing unnecessary queries
 - Simplified pagination:
    - `Table.page` is an instance attribute (no longer `@property`)
    - Exceptions raised by paginators (e.g. `EmptyPage`) are no longer
      smothered by `Table.page`
    - Pagination exceptions are raised by `Table.paginate`
    - `RequestConfig` can handles pagination errors silently, can be disabled
      by including `silent=False` in the `paginate` argument value
 - Add `DateTimeColumn` and `DateColumn` to handle formatting `datetime`
   and timezones.
 - Add `BooleanColumn` to handle bool values
 - `render_table` can now build and render a table for a queryset, rather than
   needing to be passed a table instance
 - Table columns created automatically from a model now use specialised columns
 - `Column.render` is now skipped if the value is considered *empty*, the
   default value is used instead. Empty values are specified via
   `Column.empty_values`, by default is `(None, '')` (backward incompatible)
 - Default values can now be specified on table instances or `Table.Meta`
 - Accessor's now honor `alters_data` during resolving. Fixes issue that would
   delete all your data when a column had an accessor of `delete`
 - Add `default` and `value` to context of `TemplateColumn`
 - Add cardinality indication to the pagination area of a table
 - `Attrs` is deprecated, use `dict` instead

## v0.11.0
 - Add `URLColumn` to render URLs in a data source into hyperlinks
 - Add `EmailColumn` to render email addresses into hyperlinks
 - `TemplateColumn` can now Django's template loaders to render from a file

## v0.10.4
 - Fix more bugs on Python 2.6.4, all tests now pass.

## v0.10.3
 - Fix issues for Python 2.6.4 -- thanks Steve Sapovits & brianmay
 - Reduce Django 1.3 dependency to Table.as_html -- thanks brianmay

## v0.10.2
 - Fix MANIFEST.in to include example templates, thanks TWAC.
 - Upgrade django-attest to fix problem with tests on Django 1.3.1

## v0.10.1
 - Fixed support for Django 1.4's paginator (thanks koledennix)
 - Some juggling of internal implementation.
   `TableData` now supports slicing and returns new `TableData` instances.
   `BoundRows` now takes a single argument `data` (a `TableData` instance).
 - Add support for `get_pagination` on `SingleTableMixin`.
 - `SingleTableMixin` and `SingleTableView` are now importable directly from `django_tables2`.

## v0.10.0
 - Renamed `BoundColumn.order_by` to `order_by_alias` and never returns `None`
   (**Backwards incompatible**). Templates are affected if they use something like:

       {% querystring table.prefixed_order_by_field=column.order_by.opposite|default:column.name %}

   Which should be rewritten as:

       {% querystring table.prefixed_order_by_field=column.order_by_alias.next %}

 - Added `next` shortcut to `OrderBy` returned from `BoundColumn.order_by_alias`
 - Added `OrderByTuple.get()`
 - Deprecated `BoundColumn.sortable`, `Column.sortable`, `Table.sortable`,
   `sortable` CSS class, `BoundColumns.itersortable`, `BoundColumns.sortable`; use `orderable` instead of `sortable`.
 - Added `BoundColumn.is_ordered`
 - Introduced concept of an `order by alias`, see glossary in the docs for details.

## v0.9.6
 - Fix bug that caused an ordered column's th to have no HTML attributes.

## v0.9.5
 - Updated example project to add colspan on footer cell so table border renders correctly in Webkit.
 - Fix regression that caused 'sortable' class on <th>.
 - Table.__init__ no longer *always* calls .order_by() on querysets, fixes #55.
   This does introduce a slight backwards incompatibility. `Table.order_by` now has the possibility of returning `None`, previously it would *always* return an `OrderByTuple`.
 - DeclarativeColumnsMetaclass.__new__ now uses super()
 - Testing now requires pylint and Attest >=0.5.3

## v0.9.4
 - Fix regression that caused column verbose_name values that were marked as
   safe to be escaped. Now any verbose_name values that are instances of
   SafeData are used unmodified.

## v0.9.3
 - Fix regression in `SingleTableMixin`.
 - Remove stray `print` statement.

## v0.9.2
 - `SingleTableView` now uses `RequestConfig`. This fixes issues with
   `order_by_field`, `page_field`, and `per_page_field` not being honored.
 - Add `Table.Meta.per_page` and change `Table.paginate` to use it as default.
 - Add `title` template filter. It differs from Django's built-in `title` filter
   because it operates on an individual word basis and leaves words containing
   capitals untouched. **Warning**: use `{% load ... from ... %}` to avoid
   inadvertantly replacing Django's builtin `title` template filter.
 - `BoundColumn.verbose_name` no longer does `capfirst`, titlising is now the
   responsbility of `Column.header`.
 - `BoundColumn.__unicode__` now uses `BoundColumn.header` rather than
   `BoundColumn.verbose_name`.

## v0.9.1
 - Fix version in setup.py (doh)

## v0.9.0
 - Add support for column attributes (see Attrs)
 - Add BoundRows.items() to yield (bound_column, cell) pairs
 - Tried to make docs more concise. Much stronger promotion of using
   RequestConfig and {% querystring %}

## v0.8.4
 - Removed random 'print' statements.
 - Tweaked 'paleblue' theme css to be more flexible:
   - removed `whitespace: no-wrap`
   - header background image to support more than 2 rows of text

## v0.8.3
 - Fixed stupid import mistake. Tests didn't pick it up due to them ignoring `ImportError`.

## v0.8.2
 - `SingleTableView` now inherits from `ListView` which enables automatic
   `foo_list.html` template name resolution (thanks dramon for reporting)
 - `render_table` template tag no suppresses exceptions when `DEBUG=True`

## v0.8.1
 - Fixed bug in render_table when giving it a template (issue #41)

## v0.8.0
 - Added translation support in the default template via `{% trans %}`
 - Removed `basic_table.html`, `Table.as_html()` now renders `table.html` but
   will clobber the querystring of the current request. Use the `render_table`
   template tag instead
 - `render_table` now supports an optional second argument -- the template to
   use when rendering the table
 - `Table` now supports declaring which template to use when rendering to HTML
 - Django >=1.3 is now required
 - Added support for using django-haystack's `SearchQuerySet` as a data source
 - The default template `table.html` now includes block tags to make it easy to
   extend to change small pieces
 - Fixed table template parsing problems being hidden due to a subsequent
   exception being raised
 - Http404 exceptions are no longer raised during a call to `Table.paginate()`,
   instead it now occurs when `Table.page` is accessed
 - Fixed bug where a table couldn't be rendered more than once if it was
   paginated
 - Accessing `Table.page` now returns a new page every time, rather than reusing
   a single object

## v0.7.8
 - Tables now support using both `sequence` and `exclude` (issue #32).
 - `Sequence` class moved to `django_tables2/utils.py`.
 - Table instances now support modification to the `exclude` property.
 - Removed `BoundColumns._spawn_columns`.
 - `Table.data`, `Table.rows`, and `Table.columns` are now attributes
   rather than properties.

<text>
Upgrading from django-tables Version 1
======================================

- Change your ``INSTALLLED_APPS`` entry from ``'django_tables.app'`` to
  ``'django_tables2'``.

- Change all your import references from ``django_tables`` to
  ``django_tables2``.

- Replace all references to the old ``MemoryTable`` and ``ModelTable``
  classes with simply ``Table``.

- In your templates, load the ``django_tables2`` template library;
  ``{% load django_tables2 %}`` instead of ``{% load tables %}``.

- A table object is no longer iterable; rather than ``for row in table``,
  instead you now do explicitly: ``for row in table.rows``.

- If you were using ``row.data`` to access a row's underlying data,
  replace it with ``row.record`` instead.

- When declaring columns, replace the use of::

    name_in_dataset = tables.Column(name='wanted_column_name')

  with::

    wanted_column_name = tables.Column(accessor='name_in_dataset')

- When declaring columns, replace the use of::

     column_to_override = tables.Column(name='wanted_column_name', data='name_in_dataset')

  with::

     wanted_column_name = tables.Column(accessor='name_in_dataset')

  and exclude ``column_to_override`` via the table meta data.

- When generating the link to order the column, instead of:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {% set_url_param sort=column.name_toggled %}

  use:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {% querystring table.order_by_field=column.order_by_alias.next %}

- Replace:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {{ column.is_ordered_reverse }} and {{ column.is_ordered_straight }}

  with:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {{ column.order_by.is_descending }} and {{ column.order_by.is_ascending }}

.. _query-string-fields:

Querystring fields
==================

Tables pass data via the querystring to indicate ordering and pagination
preferences.

The names of the querystring variables are configurable via the options:

- ``order_by_field`` -- default: ``'sort'``
- ``page_field`` -- default: ``'page'``
- ``per_page_field`` -- default: ``'per_page'``, **note:** this field currently
  isn't used by ``{% render_table %}``

Each of these can be specified in three places:

- ``Table.Meta.foo``
- ``Table(..., foo=...)``
- ``Table(...).foo = ...``

If you're using multiple tables on a single page, you'll want to prefix these
fields with a table-specific name, in order to prevent links on one table
interfere with those on another table::

    def people_listing(request):
        config = RequestConfig(request)
        table1 = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all(), prefix='1-')  # prefix specified
        table2 = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all(), prefix='2-')  # prefix specified
        config.configure(table1)
        config.configure(table2)

        return render(request, 'people_listing.html', {
            'table1': table1,
            'table2': table2
        })

Glossary
========

.. glossary::

    accessor
        Refers to an `.Accessor` object

    column name
        The name given to a column. In the follow example, the *column name* is
        ``age``.

        .. sourcecode:: python

            class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
                age = tables.Column()

    empty value
        An empty value is synonymous with "no value". Columns have an
        ``empty_values`` attribute that contains values that are considered
        empty. It's a way to declare which values from the database correspond
        to *null*/*blank*/*missing* etc.

    order by alias
        A prefixed column name that describes how a column should impact the
        order of data within the table. This allows the implementation of how
        a column affects ordering to be abstracted, which is useful (e.g. in
        querystrings).

        .. sourcecode:: python

            class ExampleTable(tables.Table):
                name = tables.Column(order_by=('first_name', 'last_name'))

        In this example ``-name`` and ``name`` are valid order by aliases. In
        a querystring you might then have ``?order=-name``.

    table
        The traditional concept of a table. i.e. a grid of rows and columns
        containing data.

    view
        A Django view.

    record
        A single Python object used as the data for a single row.

    render
        The act of serializing a `.Table` into
        HTML.

    template
        A Django template.

    table data
        An interable of :term:`records <record>` that
        `.Table` uses to populate its rows.

.. _pagination:

Pagination
==========

Pagination is easy, just call :meth:`.Table.paginate` and pass in the current
page number::

    def people_listing(request):
        table = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all())
        table.paginate(page=request.GET.get('page', 1), per_page=25)
        return render(request, 'people_listing.html', {'table': table})

If you're using `.RequestConfig`, pass pagination options to the constructor::

    def people_listing(request):
        table = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all())
        RequestConfig(request, paginate={'per_page': 25}).configure(table)
        return render(request, 'people_listing.html', {'table': table})

<text>
.. _localization-control:

Controlling localization
========================

Django-tables2 allows you to define which column of a table should or should not
be localized. For example you may want to use this feature in following use cases:

* You want to format some columns representing for example numeric values in the given locales
  even if you don't enable `USE_L10N` in your settings file.

* You don't want to format primary key values in your table
  even if you enabled `USE_L10N` in your settings file.

This control is done by using two filter functions in Django's `l10n` library
named `localize` and `unlocalize`. Check out Django docs about
`localization <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/i18n/formatting/>` for more information about them.

There are two ways of controlling localization in your columns.

First one is setting the `~.Column.localize` attribute in your column definition
to `True` or `False`. Like so::

     class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        id = tables.Column(name='id', accessor='pk', localize=False)
        class Meta:
            model = Person


.. note::
    The default value of the `localize` attribute is `None` which means the formatting
    of columns is dependant from the `USE_L10N` setting.

The second way is to define a `~.Table.Meta.localize` and/or `~.Table.Meta.unlocalize`
tuples in your tables Meta class (jutst like with `~.Table.Meta.fields`
or `~.Table.Meta.exclude`). You can do this like so::

     class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        id = tables.Column(accessor='pk')
        value = tables.Column(accessor='some_numerical_field')
        class Meta:
            model = Person
            unlocalize = ('id', )
            localize = ('value', )

If you define the same column in both `localize` and `unlocalize` then the value
of this column will be 'unlocalized' which means that `unlocalize` has higher precedence.

Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

After intalling django-tables2, you can follow this tutorial to start using
django-tables2.

.. note::
    For this tutorial, we'll assume you use Django version 1.8.0 or greater. For
    Django 1.7, refer to the `Django 1.7 documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/templates/api/#django-core-context-processors-request>`_.

1. ``pip install django-tables2``
2. Add ``'django_tables2'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
3. Add ``'django.template.context_processors.request'`` to the ``context_processors`` in your template setting ``OPTIONS``.


We're going to run through creating a tutorial app. Let's start with a simple model::

    # tutorial/models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(verbose_name="full name")

Add some data so you have something to display in the table. Now write a view
to pass a ``Person`` queryset into a template::

    # tutorial/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def people(request):
        return render(request, 'people.html', {'people': Person.objects.all()})

Finally, implement the template::

    {# tutorial/templates/people.html #}
    {% load render_table from django_tables2 %}
    {% load static %}
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'django_tables2/themes/paleblue/css/screen.css' %}" />
        </head>
        <body>
            {% render_table people %}
        </body>
    </html>

Hook the view up in your URLs, and load the page, you should see:

.. figure:: /_static/tutorial.png
    :align: center
    :alt: An example table rendered using django-tables2

While simple, passing a queryset directly to ``{% render_table %}`` doesn't
allow for any customisation. For that, you must define a custom `.Table` class::

    # tutorial/tables.py
    import django_tables2 as tables
    from .models import Person

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person
            # add class="paleblue" to <table> tag
            attrs = {'class': 'paleblue'}


You'll then need to instantiate and configure the table in the view, before
adding it to the context::

    # tutorial/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django_tables2 import RequestConfig
    from .models import Person
    from .tables import PersonTable

    def people(request):
        table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())
        RequestConfig(request).configure(table)
        return render(request, 'people.html', {'table': table})

Using `.RequestConfig` automatically pulls values from ``request.GET`` and
updates the table accordingly. This enables data ordering and pagination.

Rather than passing a queryset to ``{% render_table %}``, instead pass the
table instance:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% render_table table %}

At this point you haven't actually customised anything, you've merely added the
boilerplate code that ``{% render_table %}`` does for you when given a
``QuerySet``. The remaining sections in this document describe how to change
various aspects of the table.

TODO: insert links to various customisation options here.

Template filters

title
-----

String filter that performs title case conversion on a per-word basis, leaving
words containing upper-case letters alone.

.. sourcecode:: django

    {{ "start 6PM"|title }}   # Start 6PM
    {{ "sTart 6pm"|title }}   # sTart 6pm

.. warning::

    Be careful when loading the ``django_tables2`` template library to not
    inadvertently load ``title``. You should always use the
    ``{% load ... from ... %}`` syntax.

Tutorial
~~~~~~~~

After intalling django-tables2, you can follow this tutorial to start using
django-tables2.

.. note::
    For this tutorial, we'll assume you use Django version 1.8.0 or greater. For
    Django 1.7, refer to the `Django 1.7 documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/templates/api/#django-core-context-processors-request>`_.

1. ``pip install django-tables2``
2. Add ``'django_tables2'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
3. Add ``'django.template.context_processors.request'`` to the ``context_processors`` in your template setting ``OPTIONS``.


We're going to run through creating a tutorial app. Let's start with a simple model::

    # tutorial/models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(verbose_name="full name")

Add some data so you have something to display in the table. Now write a view
to pass a ``Person`` queryset into a template::

    # tutorial/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def people(request):
        return render(request, 'people.html', {'people': Person.objects.all()})

Finally, implement the template::

    {# tutorial/templates/people.html #}
    {% load render_table from django_tables2 %}
    {% load static %}
    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'django_tables2/themes/paleblue/css/screen.css' %}" />
        </head>
        <body>
            {% render_table people %}
        </body>
    </html>

Hook the view up in your URLs, and load the page, you should see:

.. figure:: /_static/tutorial.png
    :align: center
    :alt: An example table rendered using django-tables2

While simple, passing a queryset directly to ``{% render_table %}`` doesn't
allow for any customisation. For that, you must define a custom `.Table` class::

    # tutorial/tables.py
    import django_tables2 as tables
    from .models import Person

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person
            # add class="paleblue" to <table> tag
            attrs = {'class': 'paleblue'}


You'll then need to instantiate and configure the table in the view, before
adding it to the context::

    # tutorial/views.py
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from django_tables2 import RequestConfig
    from .models import Person
    from .tables import PersonTable

    def people(request):
        table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())
        RequestConfig(request).configure(table)
        return render(request, 'people.html', {'table': table})

Using `.RequestConfig` automatically pulls values from ``request.GET`` and
updates the table accordingly. This enables data ordering and pagination.

Rather than passing a queryset to ``{% render_table %}``, instead pass the
table instance:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% render_table table %}

At this point you haven't actually customised anything, you've merely added the
boilerplate code that ``{% render_table %}`` does for you when given a
``QuerySet``. The remaining sections in this document describe how to change
various aspects of the table.

.. _accessors:

Alternative column data
=======================

Each column has a 'key' that describes which value to pull from each record to
populate the column's cells. By default, this key is just the name given to the
column, but it can be changed to allow foreign key traversal or other complex
cases.

To reduce ambiguity, rather than calling it a 'key', we use the name 'accessor'.

Accessors are just dotted paths that describe how an object should be traversed
to reach a specific value, for example::

    >>> from django_tables2 import A
    >>> data = {'abc': {'one': {'two': 'three'}}}
    >>> A('abc.one.two').resolve(data)
    'three'

Dots represent a relationships, and are attempted in this order:

1. Dictionary lookup ``a[b]``
2. Attribute lookup ``a.b``
3. List index lookup ``a[int(b)]``

If the resulting value is callable, it is called and the return value is used.

Pagination
==========

Pagination is easy, just call :meth:`.Table.paginate` and pass in the current
page number::

    def people_listing(request):
        table = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all())
        table.paginate(page=request.GET.get('page', 1), per_page=25)
        return render(request, 'people_listing.html', {'table': table})

If you're using `.RequestConfig`, pass pagination options to the constructor::

    def people_listing(request):
        table = PeopleTable(Person.objects.all())
        RequestConfig(request, paginate={'per_page': 25}).configure(table)
        return render(request, 'people_listing.html', {'table': table})

.. _column-headers-and-footers:

Customizing headers and footers
===============================

By default an header and no footer will be rendered.


Adding column headers
---------------------

The header cell for each column comes from `~.Column.header`. By default this
method returns `~.Column.verbose_name`, falling back to the titlised attribute
name of the column in the table class.

When using queryset data and a verbose name hasn't been explicitly defined for
a column, the corresponding model field's `verbose_name` will be used.

Consider the following:

    >>> class Region(models.Model):
    ...     name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    ...
    >>> class Person(models.Model):
    ...     first_name = models.CharField(verbose_name='model verbose name', max_length=200)
    ...     last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    ...     region = models.ForeignKey('Region')
    ...
    >>> class PersonTable(tables.Table):
    ...     first_name = tables.Column()
    ...     ln = tables.Column(accessor='last_name')
    ...     region_name = tables.Column(accessor='region.name')
    ...
    >>> table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())
    >>> table.columns['first_name'].header
    'Model Verbose Name'
    >>> table.columns['ln'].header
    'Last Name'
    >>> table.columns['region_name'].header
    'Name'

As you can see in the last example (region name), the results are not always
desirable when an accessor is used to cross relationships. To get around this
be careful to define `.Column.verbose_name`.

.. _ordering-class-name:

Changing class names for ordered column headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a column is ordered in an ascending state there needs to be a way to show
it in the interface. django-tables2 does this by adding an `asc` class for
ascending or a `desc` class for descending. It should also be known that any
orderable column is added with an `orderable` class to the column header.

Sometimes there may be a need to change these default classes.

On the `attrs` attribute of the table, you can add a `th` key with the value of
a dictionary. Within that `th` dictionary, you may add an `_ordering` key also
with the value of a dictionary.

The `_ordering` element is optional and all elements within it are optional.
Inside you can have an `orderable` element, which will change the default
`orderable` class name. You can also have `ascending` which will will change the
default `asc` class name. And lastly, you can have `descending` which will
change the default `desc` class name.

Example::

    class Table(tables.Table):
        Meta:
            attrs = {
                'th' : {
                    '_ordering': {
                        'orderable': 'sortable', # Instead of `orderable`
                        'ascending': 'ascend',   # Instead of `asc`
                        'descending': 'descend'  # Instead of `desc`
                    }
                }
            }


It can also be specified at initialization using the `attrs` for both: table and
column::

    ATTRIBUTES = {
        'th' : {
            '_ordering': {
                'orderable': 'sortable', # Instead of `orderable`
                'ascending': 'ascend',   # Instead of `asc`
                'descending': 'descend'  # Instead of `desc`
            }
        }
    }

    table = tables.Table(queryset, attrs=ATTRIBUTES)

    # OR

    class Table(tables.Table):
        my_column = tables.Column(attrs=ATTRIBUTES)


.. _column-footers:

Adding column footers
---------------------

By default, no footer will be rendered. If you want to add a footer, define a
footer on at least one column.

That will make the table render a footer on every view of the table. It's up to
you to decide if that makes sense if your table is paginated.

Pass `footer`-argument to the `~.Column` constructor.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest case is just passing a `str` as the footer argument to a column::

    country = tables.Column(footer='Total:')

This will just render the string in the footer. If you need to do more complex
things, like showing a sum or an average, you can pass a callable::

    population = tables.Column(
        footer=lambda table: sum(x['population'] for x in table.data)
    )

You can expect `table`, `column` and `bound_column` as argument.

Define `render_footer` on a custom column.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need the same footer in multiple columns, you can create your own custom
column. For example this column that renders the sum of the values in the column::

    class SummingColumn(tables.Column):
        def render_footer(self, bound_column, table):
            return sum(bound_column.accessor.resolve(row) for row in table.data)


Then use this column like so::

    class Table(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()
        country = tables.Column(footer='Total:')
        population = SummingColumn()


.. note::

    If you are `sum`\ ming over tables with big datasets, chances are it's going
    to be slow. You should use some database aggregation function instead.

    ...     first_name = models.CharField(verbose_name='model verbose name', max_length=200)
    ...     last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    ...     region = models.ForeignKey('Region')
    ...
    >>> class PersonTable(tables.Table):
    ...     first_name = tables.Column()
    ...     ln = tables.Column(accessor='last_name')
    ...     region_name = tables.Column(accessor='region.name')
    ...
    >>> table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())
    >>> table.columns['first_name'].header
    'Model Verbose Name'
    >>> table.columns['ln'].header
    'Last Name'
    >>> table.columns['region_name'].header
    'Name'

Customizing table style
=======================

.. _css:

CSS
---

In order to use CSS to style a table, you'll probably want to add a
``class`` or ``id`` attribute to the ``<table>`` element. django-tables2 has
a hook that allows arbitrary attributes to be added to the ``<table>`` tag.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>>
    >>> class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
    ...     id = tables.Column()
    ...     age = tables.Column()
    ...
    ...     class Meta:
    ...         attrs = {'class': 'mytable'}
    ...
    >>> table = SimpleTable()
    >>> # renders to something like this:
    '<table class="mytable">...'

.. _custom-template:

Custom Template
---------------

And of course if you want full control over the way the table is rendered,
ignore the built-in generation tools, and instead pass an instance of your
`.Table` subclass into your own template, and render it yourself.

Have a look at the ``django_tables2/table.html`` template for an example.

    ...

    ...     first_name = tables.Column()
    ...     ln = tables.Column(accessor='last_name')

                'th' : {
                    '_ordering': {
                        'orderable': 'sortable', # Instead of `orderable`
                        'ascending': 'ascend',   # Instead of `asc`
                        'descending': 'descend'  # Instead of `desc`
                    }
                }
            }


It can also be specified at initialization using the `attrs` for both: table and

    table = tables.Table(queryset, attrs=ATTRIBUTES)

    # OR

.. _accessors:

Alternative column data
=======================

Various options are available for changing the way the table is :term:`rendered
<render>`. Each approach has a different balance of ease-of-use and
flexibility.


Using `~.Accessors`
-------------------

Each column has a 'key' that describes which value to pull from each record to
populate the column's cells. By default, this key is just the name given to the
column, but it can be changed to allow foreign key traversal or other complex
cases.

To reduce ambiguity, rather than calling it a 'key', we use the name 'accessor'.

Accessors are just dotted paths that describe how an object should be traversed
to reach a specific value, for example::

    >>> from django_tables2 import A
    >>> data = {'abc': {'one': {'two': 'three'}}}
    >>> A('abc.one.two').resolve(data)
    'three'

Dots represent a relationships, and are attempted in this order:

1. Dictionary lookup ``a[b]``
2. Attribute lookup ``a.b``
3. List index lookup ``a[int(b)]``

If the resulting value is callable, it is called and the return value is used.

.. _table.render_foo:

`Table.render_foo` methods
------------------------------------

To change how a column is rendered, define a ``render_foo`` method on
the table for example: `render_row_number()` for a column named `row_number`.
This approach is suitable if you have a one-off change that you do not want to
use in multiple tables.

Supported keyword arguments include:

- ``record`` -- the entire record for the row from the :term:`table data`
- ``value`` -- the value for the cell retrieved from the :term:`table data`
- ``column`` -- the `.Column` object
- ``bound_column`` -- the `.BoundColumn` object
- ``bound_row`` -- the `.BoundRow` object
- ``table`` -- alias for ``self``

This example shows how to render the row number in the first row::

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>> import itertools
    >>> class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
    ...     row_number = tables.Column(empty_values=())
    ...     id = tables.Column()
    ...     age = tables.Column()
    ...
    ...     def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    ...         super(SimpleTable, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    ...         self.counter = itertools.count()
    ...
    ...     def render_row_number(self):
    ...         return 'Row %d' % next(self.counter)
    ...
    ...     def render_id(self, value):
    ...         return '<%s>' % value
    ...
    >>> table = SimpleTable([{'age': 31, 'id': 10}, {'age': 34, 'id': 11}])
    >>> print ', '.join(map(str, table.rows[0]))
    Row 0, <10>, 31

Python's `inspect.getargspec` is used to only pass the arguments declared by the
function. This means it's not necessary to add a catch all (``**``) keyword
argument.

.. important::

    `render` methods are *only* called if the value for a cell is determined to
    be not an :term:`empty value`. When a value is in `.Column.empty_values`,
    a default value is rendered instead (both `.Column.render` and
    ``Table.render_FOO`` are skipped).

.. _subclassing-column:

Subclassing `.Column`
---------------------

Defining a column subclass allows functionality to be reused across tables.
Columns have a `render` method that behaves the same as :ref:`table.render_foo`
methods on tables::

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>>
    >>> class UpperColumn(tables.Column):
    ...     def render(self, value):
    ...         return value.upper()
    ...
    >>> class Example(tables.Table):
    ...     normal = tables.Column()
    ...     upper = UpperColumn()
    ...
    >>> data = [{'normal': 'Hi there!',
    ...          'upper':  'Hi there!'}]
    ...
    >>> table = Example(data)
    >>> # renders to something like this:
    '''<table>
        <thead><tr><th>Normal</th><th>Upper</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td>Hi there!</td><td>HI THERE!</td></tr></tbody>
    </table>'''

See :ref:`table.render_foo` for a list of arguments that can be accepted.

For complicated columns, you may want to return HTML from the
:meth:`~Column.render` method. Make sure to use Django's html formatting functions::

    >>> from django.utils.html import format_html
    >>>
    >>> class ImageColumn(tables.Column):
    ...     def render(self, value):
    ...         return format_html('<img src="/media/img/{}.jpg" />', value)
    ...

.. _column-attributes:

Column attributes
=================

Column attributes can be specified using the `dict` with specific keys.
The dict defines HTML attributes for one of more elements within the column.
Depending on the column, different elements are supported, however ``th``,
``td``, and ``cell`` are supported universally::

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>>
    >>> class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
    ...     name = tables.Column(attrs={'th': {'id': 'foo'}})
    ...
    >>> # will render something like this:
    '{snip}<thead><tr><th id="foo" class="name">{snip}<tbody><tr><td class="name">{snip}'


For ``th`` and ``td``, the column name will be added as a class name. This makes
selecting the row for styling easier.
Have a look at each column's API reference to find which elements are supported.


.. _row-attributes:

Row attributes
==============

Row attributes can be specified using a dict defining the HTML attributes for
the ``<tr>`` element on each row. The values of the dict may be

By default, class names *odd* and *even* are supplied to the rows, wich can be
customized using the ``row_attrs`` `.Table.Meta` attribute or as argument to the
constructor of `.Table`, for example::

    class Table(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = User
            row_attrs = {
                'data-id': lambda record: record.pk
            }

will render tables with the following ``<tr>`` tag

.. sourcecode:: django

    <tr class="odd" data-id="1"> [...] </tr>
    <tr class="even" data-id="2"> [...] </tr>

Upgrading from django-tables Version 1
======================================

- Change your ``INSTALLLED_APPS`` entry from ``'django_tables.app'`` to
  ``'django_tables2'``.

- Change all your import references from ``django_tables`` to
  ``django_tables2``.

- Replace all references to the old ``MemoryTable`` and ``ModelTable``
  classes with simply ``Table``.

- In your templates, load the ``django_tables2`` template library;
  ``{% load django_tables2 %}`` instead of ``{% load tables %}``.

- A table object is no longer iterable; rather than ``for row in table``,
  instead you now do explicitly: ``for row in table.rows``.

- If you were using ``row.data`` to access a row's underlying data,
  replace it with ``row.record`` instead.

- When declaring columns, replace the use of::

    name_in_dataset = tables.Column(name='wanted_column_name')

  with::

    wanted_column_name = tables.Column(accessor='name_in_dataset')

- When declaring columns, replace the use of::

     column_to_override = tables.Column(name='wanted_column_name', data='name_in_dataset')

  with::

     wanted_column_name = tables.Column(accessor='name_in_dataset')

  and exclude ``column_to_override`` via the table meta data.

- When generating the link to order the column, instead of:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {% set_url_param sort=column.name_toggled %}

  use:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {% querystring table.order_by_field=column.order_by_alias.next %}

- Replace:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {{ column.is_ordered_reverse }} and {{ column.is_ordered_straight }}

  with:

  .. sourcecode:: django

      {{ column.order_by.is_descending }} and {{ column.order_by.is_ascending }}

Customizing table style
=======================

.. _css:

CSS
---

In order to use CSS to style a table, you'll probably want to add a
``class`` or ``id`` attribute to the ``<table>`` element. django-tables2 has
a hook that allows arbitrary attributes to be added to the ``<table>`` tag.

.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> import django_tables2 as tables
    >>>
    >>> class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
    ...     id = tables.Column()
    ...     age = tables.Column()
    ...
    ...     class Meta:
    ...         attrs = {'class': 'mytable'}
    ...
    >>> table = SimpleTable()
    >>> # renders to something like this:
    '<table class="mytable">...'

.. _custom-template:

Custom Template
---------------

And of course if you want full control over the way the table is rendered,
ignore the built-in generation tools, and instead pass an instance of your
`.Table` subclass into your own template, and render it yourself.

Have a look at the ``django_tables2/table.html`` template for an example.

.. _swapping-columns:

Swapping the position of columns
================================

By default columns are positioned in the same order as they are declared,
however when mixing auto-generated columns (via `Table.Meta.model`) with
manually declared columns, the column sequence becomes ambiguous.

To resolve the ambiguity, columns sequence can be declared via the
`.Table.Meta.sequence` option::

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        selection = tables.CheckBoxColumn(accessor='pk', orderable=False)

        class Meta:
            model = Person
            sequence = ('selection', 'first_name', 'last_name')

The special value ``'...'`` can be used to indicate that any omitted columns
should inserted at that location. As such it can be used at most once.

Performance
-----------

Django-tables tries to be efficient in displaying big datasets. It tries to
avoid converting the `~django.db.models.query.QuerySet` instances to lists by
using SQL to slice the data and should be able to handle datasets with 100k
records without a problem.

However, when using one of the customisation methods described in this
documentation, there is lot's of oppurtunity to introduce slowness.
If you experience that, try to strip the table of customisations and re-add them
one by one, checking for performance after each step.

Built-in columns
================

For common use-cases the following columns are included:

- `.BooleanColumn` -- renders boolean values
- `.Column` -- generic column
- `.CheckBoxColumn` -- renders checkbox form inputs
- `.DateColumn` -- date formatting
- `.DateTimeColumn` -- datetime formatting in the local timezone
- `.FileColumn` -- renders files as links
- `.EmailColumn` -- renders ``<a href="mailto:...">`` tags
- `.LinkColumn` -- renders ``<a href="...">`` tags (compose a django url)
- `.RelatedLinkColumn` -- renders ``<a href="...">`` tags linking related objects
- `.TemplateColumn` -- renders template code
- `.URLColumn` -- renders ``<a href="...">`` tags (absolute url)

.. _tables-for-models:

Tables for models
=================

If you build use tables to display `.QuerySet` data, rather than defining each
column manually in the table, the `.Table.Meta.model` option allows tables to
be dynamically created based on a model::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        user = models.ForeignKey("auth.User")
        dob = models.DateField()

    # tables.py
    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        class Meta:
            model = Person

This has a number of benefits:

- Less code, easier to write, more DRY
- Columns use the field's `~.models.Field.verbose_name`
- Specialized columns are used where possible (e.g. `.DateColumn` for a
  `~.models.DateField`)

When using this approach, the following options are useful:

- `~.Table.Meta.sequence` -- reorder columns
- `~.Table.Meta.fields` -- specify model fields to *include*
- `~.Table.Meta.exclude` -- specify model fields to *exclude*

.. _template_tags:

Template tags
=============

.. _template-tags.render_table:

render_table
------------

Renders a `~django_tables2.tables.Table` object to HTML and enables as
many features in the output as possible.

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% load django_tables2 %}
    {% render_table table %}

    {# Alternatively a specific template can be used #}
    {% render_table table "path/to/custom_table_template.html" %}

If the second argument (template path) is given, the template will be rendered
with a `.RequestContext` and the table will be in the variable ``table``.

.. note::

    This tag temporarily modifies the `.Table` object during rendering. A
    ``context`` attribute is added to the table, providing columns with access
    to the current context for their own rendering (e.g. `.TemplateColumn`).

This tag requires that the template in which it's rendered contains the
`~.http.HttpRequest` inside a ``request`` variable. This can be achieved by
ensuring the ``TEMPLATES[]['OPTIONS']['context_processors']`` setting contains
``django.template.context_processors.request``.
Please refer to the Django documentation for the TEMPLATES-setting_.

.. _TEMPLATES-setting: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-TEMPLATES

.. _template-tags.querystring:

querystring
-----------

A utility that allows you to update a portion of the query-string without
overwriting the entire thing.

Let's assume we have the querystring ``?search=pirates&sort=name&page=5`` and
we want to update the ``sort`` parameter:

.. sourcecode:: django

    {% querystring "sort"="dob" %}           # ?search=pirates&sort=dob&page=5
    {% querystring "sort"="" %}              # ?search=pirates&page=5
    {% querystring "sort"="" "search"="" %}  # ?page=5

    {% with "search" as key %}               # supports variables as keys
    {% querystring key="robots" %}           # ?search=robots&page=5
    {% endwith %}

This tag requires the ``django.template.context_processors.request`` context
processor, see :ref:`template-tags.render_table`.

Alternative column ordering
===========================

When using queryset data, one might want to show a computed value which is not
in the database. In this case, attempting to order the column will cause an
exception::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        family_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)

        @property
        def name(self):
            return '{} {}'.format(self.first_name, self.family_name)

    # tables.py
    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

::

    >>> table = PersonTable(Person.objects.all())
    >>> table.order_by = 'name'
    >>>
    >>> # will result in:
    FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'name' into field. Choices are: first_name, family_name

To prevent this, django-tables2 allows two ways to specify custom ordering:
accessors and :meth:`~.order_FOO` methods.

.. _order-by-accessors:

Ordering by accessors
---------------------

You can supply an ``order_by`` argument containing a name or a tuple of the
names of the columns the database should use to sort it::

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column(order_by=('first_name', 'family_name'))

`~.Accessor` syntax can be used as well, as long as they point to a model field.

If ordering does not make sense for a particular column, it can be disabled via
the ``orderable`` argument::

    class SimpleTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()
        actions = tables.Column(orderable=False)


.. _table.order_foo:

:meth:`table.order_FOO` methods
--------------------------------

Another solution for alternative ordering is being able to chain functions on to
the original queryset. This method allows more complex functionality giving the
ability to use all of Django's QuerySet API.

Adding a `Table.order_FOO` method (where `FOO` is the name of the column),
gives you the ability to chain to, or modify, the original queryset when that
column is selected to be ordered.

The method takes two arguments: `queryset`, and `is_descending`. The return
must be a tuple of two elements. The first being the queryset and the second
being a boolean; note that modified queryset will only be used if the boolean is
`True`.

For example, let's say instead of ordering alphabetically, ordering by
amount of characters in the first_name is desired.
The implementation would look like this:
::

    # tables.py
    from django.db.models.functions import Length

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        name = tables.Column()

        def order_name(self, queryset, is_descending):
            queryset = queryset.annotate(
                length=Length('first_name')
            ).order_by(('-' if is_descending else '') + 'length')
            return (queryset, True)



As another example, presume the situation calls for being able to order by a
mathematical expression. In this scenario, the table needs to be able to be
ordered by the sum of both the shirts and the pants. The custom column will
have its value rendered using :ref:`table.render_FOO`.

This can be achieved like this::

    # models.py
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        family_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        shirts = models.IntegerField()
        pants = models.IntegerField()


    # tables.py
    from django.db.models import F

    class PersonTable(tables.Table):
        clothing = tables.Column()

        class Meta:
            model = Person

        def render_clothing(self, record):
            return str(record.shirts + record.pants)

        def order_clothing(self, queryset, is_descending):
            queryset = queryset.annotate(
                amount=F('shirts') + F('pants')
            ).order_by(('-' if is_descending else '') + 'amount')
            return (queryset, True)

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
   3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
   4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
   6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
   7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
   8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
   9. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   5.

      For the avoidance of doubt:
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Dimension by HTML5 UP

Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
   2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
   3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
   4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
   5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
   6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
   7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
   8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
   9. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   5.

      For the avoidance of doubt:
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)

                                 Apache License
                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

Introduction
============
This package contains utilities used to package some of STScI's Python
projects; specifically those projects that comprise stsci_python_ and
Astrolib_.

It currently consists mostly of some setup_hook scripts meant for use with
`distutils2/packaging`_ and/or pbr_, and a customized easy_install command
meant for use with distribute_.

This package is not meant for general consumption, though it might be worth
looking at for examples of how to do certain things with your own packages, but
YMMV.

Features
========

Hook Scripts
------------
Currently the main features of this package are a couple of setup_hook scripts.
In distutils2, a setup_hook is a script that runs at the beginning of any
pysetup command, and can modify the package configuration read from setup.cfg.
There are also pre- and post-command hooks that only run before/after a
specific setup command (eg. build_ext, install) is run.

stsci.distutils.hooks.use_packages_root
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
If using the ``packages_root`` option under the ``[files]`` section of
setup.cfg, this hook will add that path to ``sys.path`` so that modules in your
package can be imported and used in setup.  This can be used even if
``packages_root`` is not specified--in this case it adds ``''`` to
``sys.path``.

stsci.distutils.hooks.version_setup_hook
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Creates a Python module called version.py which currently contains four
variables:

* ``__version__`` (the release version)
* ``__svn_revision__`` (the SVN revision info as returned by the ``svnversion``
  command)
* ``__svn_full_info__`` (as returned by the ``svn info`` command)
* ``__setup_datetime__`` (the date and time that setup.py was last run).

These variables can be imported in the package's `__init__.py` for degugging
purposes.  The version.py module will *only* be created in a package that
imports from the version module in its `__init__.py`.  It should be noted that
this is generally preferable to writing these variables directly into
`__init__.py`, since this provides more control and is less likely to
unexpectedly break things in `__init__.py`.

stsci.distutils.hooks.version_pre_command_hook
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Identical to version_setup_hook, but designed to be used as a pre-command
hook.

stsci.distutils.hooks.version_post_command_hook
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The complement to version_pre_command_hook.  This will delete any version.py
files created during a build in order to prevent them from cluttering an SVN
working copy (note, however, that version.py is *not* deleted from the build/
directory, so a copy of it is still preserved).  It will also not be deleted
if the current directory is not an SVN working copy.  For example, if source
code extracted from a source tarball it will be preserved.

stsci.distutils.hooks.tag_svn_revision
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
A setup_hook to add the SVN revision of the current working copy path to the
package version string, but only if the version ends in .dev.

For example, ``mypackage-1.0.dev`` becomes ``mypackage-1.0.dev1234``.  This is
in accordance with the version string format standardized by PEP 386.

This should be used as a replacement for the ``tag_svn_revision`` option to
the egg_info command.  This hook is more compatible with packaging/distutils2,
which does not include any VCS support.  This hook is also more flexible in
that it turns the revision number on/off depending on the presence of ``.dev``
in the version string, so that it's not automatically added to the version in
final releases.

This hook does require the ``svnversion`` command to be available in order to
work.  It does not examine the working copy metadata directly.

stsci.distutils.hooks.numpy_extension_hook
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
This is a pre-command hook for the build_ext command.  To use it, add a
``[build_ext]`` section to your setup.cfg, and add to it::

    pre-hook.numpy-extension-hook = stsci.distutils.hooks.numpy_extension_hook

This hook must be used to build extension modules that use Numpy.   The primary
side-effect of this hook is to add the correct numpy include directories to
`include_dirs`.  To use it, add 'numpy' to the 'include-dirs' option of each
extension module that requires numpy to build.  The value 'numpy' will be
replaced with the actual path to the numpy includes.

stsci.distutils.hooks.is_display_option
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
This is not actually a hook, but is a useful utility function that can be used
in writing other hooks.  Basically, it returns ``True`` if setup.py was run
with a "display option" such as --version or --help.  This can be used to
prevent your hook from running in such cases.

stsci.distutils.hooks.glob_data_files
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
A pre-command hook for the install_data command.  Allows filename wildcards as
understood by ``glob.glob()`` to be used in the data_files option.  This hook
must be used in order to have this functionality since it does not normally
exist in distutils.

This hook also ensures that data files are installed relative to the package
path.  data_files shouldn't normally be installed this way, but the
functionality is required for a few special cases.


Commands
--------
build_optional_ext
''''''''''''''''''
This serves as an optional replacement for the default built_ext command,
which compiles C extension modules.  Its purpose is to allow extension modules
to be *optional*, so that if their build fails the rest of the package is
still allowed to be built and installed.  This can be used when an extension
module is not definitely required to use the package.

To use this custom command, add::

    commands = stsci.distutils.command.build_optional_ext.build_optional_ext

under the ``[global]`` section of your package's setup.cfg.  Then, to mark
an individual extension module as optional, under the setup.cfg section for
that extension add::

    optional = True

Optionally, you may also add a custom failure message by adding::

    fail_message = The foobar extension module failed to compile.
                   This could be because you lack such and such headers.
                   This package will still work, but such and such features
                   will be disabled.

Changelog
===========

0.3 (unreleased)
------------------

- The ``glob_data_files`` hook became a pre-command hook for the install_data
  command instead of being a setup-hook.  This is to support the additional
  functionality of requiring data_files with relative destination paths to be
  install relative to the package's install path (i.e. site-packages).

- Dropped support for and deprecated the easier_install custom command.
  Although it should still work, it probably won't be used anymore for
  stsci_python packages.

- Added support for the ``build_optional_ext`` command, which replaces/extends
  the default ``build_ext`` command.  See the README for more details.

- Added the ``tag_svn_revision`` setup_hook as a replacement for the
  setuptools-specific tag_svn_revision option to the egg_info command.  This
  new hook is easier to use than the old tag_svn_revision option: It's
  automatically enabled by the presence of ``.dev`` in the version string, and
  disabled otherwise.

- The ``svn_info_pre_hook`` and ``svn_info_post_hook`` have been replaced with
  ``version_pre_command_hook`` and ``version_post_command_hook`` respectively.
  However, a new ``version_setup_hook``, which has the same purpose, has been
  added.  It is generally easier to use and will give more consistent results
  in that it will run every time setup.py is run, regardless of which command
  is used.  ``stsci.distutils`` itself uses this hook--see the `setup.cfg` file
  and `stsci/distutils/__init__.py` for example usage.

- Instead of creating an `svninfo.py` module, the new ``version_`` hooks create
  a file called `version.py`.  In addition to the SVN info that was included
  in `svninfo.py`, it includes a ``__version__`` variable to be used by the
  package's `__init__.py`.  This allows there to be a hard-coded
  ``__version__`` variable included in the source code, rather than using
  pkg_resources to get the version.

- In `version.py`, the variables previously named ``__svn_version__`` and
  ``__full_svn_info__`` are now named ``__svn_revision__`` and
  ``__svn_full_info__``.

- Fixed a bug when using stsci.distutils in the installation of other packages
  in the ``stsci.*`` namespace package.  If stsci.distutils was not already
  installed, and was downloaded automatically by distribute through the
  setup_requires option, then ``stsci.distutils`` would fail to import.  This
  is because the way the namespace package (nspkg) mechanism currently works,
  all packages belonging to the nspkg *must* be on the import path at initial
  import time.

  So when installing stsci.tools, for example, if ``stsci.tools`` is imported
  from within the source code at install time, but before ``stsci.distutils``
  is downloaded and added to the path, the ``stsci`` package is already
  imported and can't be extended to include the path of ``stsci.distutils``
  after the fact.  The easiest way of dealing with this, it seems, is to
  delete ``stsci`` from ``sys.modules``, which forces it to be reimported, now
  the its ``__path__`` extended to include ``stsci.distutil``'s path.


0.2.2 (2011-11-09)
------------------

- Fixed check for the issue205 bug on actual setuptools installs; before it
  only worked on distribute.  setuptools has the issue205 bug prior to version
  0.6c10.

- Improved the fix for the issue205 bug, especially on setuptools.
  setuptools, prior to 0.6c10, did not back of sys.modules either before
  sandboxing, which causes serious problems.  In fact, it's so bad that it's
  not enough to add a sys.modules backup to the current sandbox: It's in fact
  necessary to monkeypatch setuptools.sandbox.run_setup so that any subsequent
  calls to it also back up sys.modules.


0.2.1 (2011-09-02)
------------------

- Fixed the dependencies so that setuptools is requirement but 'distribute'
  specifically.  Previously installation could fail if users had plain
  setuptools installed and not distribute

0.2 (2011-08-23)
------------------

- Initial public release

test specifically:
failed accept error message -- similar to test_tcp_internals
immediate success on accept/connect/recv, including Event.ignore
parametrize iocpsupport somehow -- via reactor?

do:
break handling -- WaitForSingleObject on the IOCP handle?
iovecs for write buffer
do not wait for a mainloop iteration if resumeProducing (in _handleWrite) does startWriting
don't addActiveHandle in every call to startWriting/startReading
iocpified process support
  win32er-in-a-thread (or run GQCS in a thread -- it can't receive SIGBREAK)
blocking in sendto() -- I think Windows can do that, especially with local UDP

buildbot:
run in vmware
start from a persistent snapshot

use a stub inside the vm to svnup/run tests/collect stdio
lift logs through SMB? or ship them via tcp beams to the VM host

have a timeout on the test run
if we time out, take a screenshot, save it, kill the VM

ISO SCHEMATRON 2009

XSLT implementation by Rick Jelliffe with assistance from members of Schematron-love-in maillist.

2009-03-18

Two distributions are available. One is for XSLT1 engines. 
The other is for XSLT2 engines, such as SAXON 9.


This version of Schematron splits the process into a pipeline of several different XSLT stages.

1) First, preprocess your Schematron schema with iso_dsdl_include.xsl.  
This is a macro processor to assemble the schema from various parts. 
If your schema is not in separate parts, you can skip this stage.

2) Second, preprocess the output from stage 1 with iso_abstract_expand.xsl.  
This is a macro processor to convert abstract patterns to real patterns. 
If your schema does not use abstract patterns, you can skip this
stage.

3) Third, compile the Schematron schema into an XSLT script. 
This will typically use iso_svrl_for_xslt1.xsl or iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl 
(which in turn invoke iso_schematron_skeleton_for_xslt1.xsl or iso_schematron_skeleton_for_saxon.xsl)
However, other "meta-styleseets" are also in common use; the principle of operation is the same.
If your schema uses Schematron phases, supply these as command line/invocation parameters
to this process.

4) Fourth, run the script generated by stage 3 against the document being validated.
If you are using the SVRL script, then the output of validation will be an XML document.
If your schema uses Schematron parameters, supply these as command line/invocation parameters
to this process. 


The XSLT2 distribution also features several next generation features, 
such as validating multiple documents. See the source code for details.

Schematron assertions can be written in any language, of course; the file
sch-messages-en.xhtml contains the diagnostics messages from the XSLT2 skeleton
in English, and this can be used as template to localize the skeleton's
error messages. Note that typically programming errors in Schematron are XPath
errors, which requires localized messages from the XSLT engine.

ANT

To give an example of how to process a document, here is a sample ANT task.

<target  name="schematron-compile-test" >

	   <!-- expand inclusions -->
	   <xslt basedir="test/schematron"
	   		style="iso_dsdl_include.xsl" in="test.sch"  out="test1.sch"> 
	   				<classpath>
	   					<pathelement location="${lib.dir}/saxon9.jar"/>
	   				</classpath>
	   </xslt>

	   <!-- expand abstract patterns -->
	   <xslt basedir="test/schematron"
	   		style="iso_abstract_expand.xsl" in="test1.sch"  out="test2.sch"> 
	   				<classpath>
	   					<pathelement location="${lib.dir}/saxon9.jar"/>
	   				</classpath>
	   </xslt>



	   <!-- compile it -->
	   <xslt basedir="test/schematron"

	   <!-- validate -->
	   <xslt basedir="test/schematron"

      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
